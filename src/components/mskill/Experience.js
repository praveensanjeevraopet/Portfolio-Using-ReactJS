          des="Face recognition technology is widely used for biometric identification due to its non-intrusive, touchless nature. It enhances attendance management in educational institutions by streamlining the process and reducing proxy attendance. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the system captures images to build a database. It detects and recognizes faces in real-time from live-streaming video in classrooms. This solution improves efficiency and accuracy in attendance tracking.I have used Technologies & Tools are  Python, Conventional Neural Networks, Support Vector Missions, MySql, Git, Tkinter python library for UI, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse .

          des="Driver fatigue is a major cause of accidents globally, with drowsiness detection being a reliable measure. This project aims to develop a non-intrusive drowsiness detection system that monitors the driver’s eyes in real-time. It detects blinks and yawns, sounding an alarm if the driver’s eyes remain closed for too long. Using simple Python code and Dlib for detection, the system enhances driver safety without being intrusive. Additionally, a hardware solution utilizing infrared light is proposed to further address drowsiness-related issues."
